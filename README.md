## Hi there! üëè

Glad to see you here.

I am Tong Hoang Vu, a Java backend developer and a university student. I love programming and writing technical blog.

I have experience with Java, Spring Boot and MongoDB. Besides, I also know about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little knowledge for frontend development.

Currently, I am digging into the Java ecosystem and trying something new, such as Go, Kotlin, Vue, Docker, etc.
