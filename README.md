## Hi there! üëè

I'm Vu Tong, a tech enthusiast, mainly in Java and JavaScript.

I have over one year of experience in web backend development with Java Spring.

In my free time, I write technical blogs and do open-source projects for sharing.

Currently, I'm digging into the Java ecosystem and trying something new, for example, Azure and SolidJS.
