# Hi there! 👏

I'm Vu Tong, a tech enthusiast in Java and JavaScript.
I do open-source projects and write blogs in my free time.
Currently, I'm digging into the Java ecosystem and trying Vue and Azure (for work).

I'm also the owner of [Pocketo project](https://github.com/pocketo-org), an OSS focused on documentation, code quality, and testing.
Please check it out, you might love it at first sight 🥳
