## Hi there! üëè

Glad to see you here.

I am Tong Hoang Vu, a Java backend developer, and a university student. I love programming and writing technical blogs.

I have experience with Java, Spring Boot, and JPA (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Besides, I also know about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little knowledge of frontend development (NPM, Yarn, ESLint, Prettier).

Currently, I am digging into the Java ecosystem and trying something new, such as Azure and SolidJS.
